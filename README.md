scripta
=======

scripta is a (untidy) collection of scripts that is supposed to perform repetitive operations from command line. Currently, it allows to perform the following operations:
* convert between matrices / networks representations from command line (adjacency list, adjacency matrix, edgelist) (some are TODOs).
* curb a matrix;
* calculate mutual information;
* normalize matrix (TODO)
* make a density plot.

The library needs numpy/matplotlib/scipy or the whole pylab environment.
